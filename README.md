This is a sort of a twitterBot puzzle crowdsourcing platform.

The goat is to have people anonymously create puzzles that will show up on a dedicated twitter page. Users can visit the website (still local host now) and guess using the hashes that get created for each puzzle created.

This site will never allow curse words to appear, instead replacing anything with \*'s.

The goes is to make the twitter bot part smarter and begin listening for correct answers and letting users know if they are correct or incorrect.
